.SH NAME
remove_brackets \- remove delimiters from text

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B remove_brackets
.I delimiter1 delimiter2

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIremove_brackets\fP is a filter that removes the specified delimiters from
the beginning/end of the text sent through it. It reads text from stdin and
writes the result to stdout. The delimiters can be arbitrary characters, but
things like \fB{ }\fP, \fB( )\fP, etc. are most common. The delimiters are
removed only if both of them match.
.PP
Please note that \fIremove_brackets\fP is intended mainly to be run from XView's
text menu. It is used in the default \fBtext_extras_menu\fP.
