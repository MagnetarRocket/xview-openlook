The chooser_service executable must be in the path that ttsession
searches for starting handlers.  One way to ensure this is to start
the ttsession in the same directory as the chooser_service executable
with the following command:

		ttsession -d $DISPLAY

The ChooserService.types file is compiled into the classing engine.  If
the ttsession was already running, then a "kill -USR2" needs to be
sent to the ttsession to force it to re-read the types.

The driver executable is the executable to run to see the example.
